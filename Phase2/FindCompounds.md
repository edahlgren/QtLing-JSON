# Find compounds

In [QtLing](https://github.com/edahlgren/QtLing/tree/6df4bf4898274a26db7fc961f4cc7e8f7c0a91eb/QtLing) this would be [CLexicon::step10_find_compounds()](https://github.com/edahlgren/QtLing/blob/6df4bf4898274a26db7fc961f4cc7e8f7c0a91eb/QtLing/compound.cpp#L11). Since all write behavior to `m_Compounds` is disabled we skip this step.
